# poker-bot

The goal of this project is to create a poker bot that will help the player in-game, thereby giving them a higher chance of winning. In a classic Texas Hold'em poker game, the player has 2 cards in their hand and up to 5 cards on the table. 
Based on those cards, the bot will calculate the chances of winning a round and give suggestions on how to play further, such as whether to fold, check, raise, and by how much.

THIS IS A PROJECT IN PROGRESS! IT IS NOT USABLE RIGHT NOW!
